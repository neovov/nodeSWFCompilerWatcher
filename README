This is a node.js script to launch the Flex compiler (or whatever AS compiler you want) when hitting save in your prefered editor.

== Installation ==
1) Install node.js
2) Get the latest flex SDK and put it whatever you want
3) Configure the compiler server (server.js)
4) Have fun!

== Configuration ==
You have to modify some variables in order to fit to your project hierarchy.

Open server.js and locate/modify those variables :
  - folders: The folders where your files are located
   - build: The folder where to build the SWF file
   - src: The folder where to watch for source files
  - main: The Main class to use in the compiler
  - compiler: Where to find the SWF compiler (bin/mxmlc in the flex SDK folder), can be absolute and relative
  - parameters: The compiler parameters

That’s it, you’re ready to use the script!

== Usage ==
Using a Terminal, go to the server.js folder and launch:
node server.js

Then, you can open your AS sources files and start working.

== TODO ==
Actually, the server watch only the .as file in the folders.src folder. In the future, it’ll be able to watch the folders.src sub-folders for .as files too.
